# VISCOSITY-IOT-SENSOR-INTEGRATION

## Overview
The VISCOSITY-IOT-SENSOR-INTEGRATION project is designed to integrate various IoT sensors to measure and monitor the viscosity of fluids. This project primarily uses Python for its implementation, along with some JavaScript for front-end interaction, and PowerShell for script automation.

## Features
- **Sensor Integration**: Interface with multiple IoT sensors to collect viscosity data.
- **Data Processing**: Process and analyze the collected data to derive meaningful insights.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Monitor viscosity changes in real-time through a web interface.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Set up alerts and notifications based on predefined thresholds.

## Installation
To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/bryan936M/VISCOSITY-IOT-SENSOR-INTEGRATION.git
    cd VISCOSITY-IOT-SENSOR-INTEGRATION
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables:
    ```sh
    SENSOR_API_KEY=<your_sensor_api_key>
    DATABASE_URL=<your_database_url>
    ```

4. **Run the application**:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage
1. **Configure Sensors**:
    - Connect your IoT sensors to the system.
    - Update the `config/sensors.json` file with the appropriate sensor configurations.

2. **Start Monitoring**:
    - Run the application to start collecting and analyzing viscosity data.
    - Access the web interface at `http://localhost:8000` to view real-time data and graphs.
